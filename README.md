# odin-landingpage

This project is about creating and designing a webpage with html and css.

For this project, flexbox is used to order the items on the webpage. This is the first time i use flexbox and it's pretty fun and easy to use once you understand how it works.

I first just copied the dummy text from the desired outcome pictures but then decided to add some content of personal interest and add some pictures to get better used to handle pictures and how to resize them.
especially handling the pictures in the info-section with the most successful F1 teams was a little challenging but super helpful.
