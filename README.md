# odin-landingpage

This project is about creating and designing a webpage with html and css.

For this project, flexbox is used to order the items on the webpage. This is the first time i use flexbox and it's pretty fun and easy to use once you understand how it works.

I first just copied the dummy text from the desired outcome pictures but then decided to add some content of personal interest and add some pictures to get better used to handle pictures and how to resize them.
especially handling the pictures in the info-section with the most successful F1 teams was a little challenging but super helpful.

I decided to mention the picture sources directly on the website. I also tried to play a little bit around with the links and how to open them in a new tab.

Over all, this project helped me alot in understanding flexbox and the basic CSS properties. Furthermore, i guess i need to work more on my commit messages and need to make more atomic commits. Especially the last few commits were a little bit messy when i put a few things together. definetly need to work on that more.
